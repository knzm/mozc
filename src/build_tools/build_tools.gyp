# The gyp file is used for pre-building code generation tools.
#
# In particualr, generating embedded_dictionary_data.h (140+ MB) with
# converter_compiler_main is slow (can take several minutes).
#
# If we simply add a dependency from embedded_dictionary_data.h to
# converter_compiler_main binary, we end up re-generating the header file
# every time converter_compiler_main binary is rebuilt. This can happen by
# a change as simple as fixing a comment in base/util.h, as
# converter_compiler_main depends on base/util.h.
#
# To solve the problem, we pre-build converter_compiler_main and use the
# pre-built version in mozc_tools directory for code generation.
#
# In order to build products for Chrome OS, we also pre-build all the other code
# generation tools. They need to be built for the host machine rather than the
# target machine.
